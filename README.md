IRC bot written in io

Just spent few hours playing with Jim bot (http://github.com/iownbey/jim) . Now it's retrieving information from git repositories.

    ?git jquery 
    
returns __http://github.com/jquery/jquery - jQuery JavaScript Library__

    ?git yajl @ Antaranian
    
returns __Antaranian: http://github.com/brianmario/yajl-ruby - An extremely efficient streaming JSON parsing and encoding library. Ruby C bindings to Yajl__
